This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) in Verilog HDL, including both Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) modules, a Baud Rate Generator, and a top-level integration module. The design is fully synthesizable and verified through simulation testbenches.

UART is a widely used asynchronous serial communication protocol for transmitting data between devices. This implementation is suitable for FPGA/ASIC applications and can be integrated into larger digital systems.
